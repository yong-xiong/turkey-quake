# Turkey Earthquake and Aftershock count

# Project Introduction
Since the magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck southern and central Turkey early on the morning of February 6th, nearly 50,000 people have been killed in what is now the deadliest earthquake in the country’s modern history.

Less than ten hours after the initial earthquake, a subsequent magnitude 7.6 earthquake rocked the area less than 100km away from the city of Gaziantep, where the first shock was felt, causing further damage and casualties. Videos on social media showed buildings collapsing in front of rescuers’ eyes.

While it’s normal for aftershocks to occur after a major earthquake, the frequency and intensity of subsequent quakes and aftershocks in the Turkey-Syria earthquake are rare. This project uses data from the [United States Geological Survey (USGS)](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/?extent=30.88337,-690.84229&extent=43.2452,-674.09912&range=week&settings=true) to automatically update the statistics and and the chart on the [project website](https://yong-xiong.github.io/turkey-quake/).
